Hullo, for the above blocks of code, I am dynamically creating list items with links adding them to DOM by appending them to an ul list using a  for loop. The links are then assigned a fetch function to send data to a flask function on the server side, the fetch function runs when a link is clicked.However there seems to be abug in my code because whenever the link is clicked, I get the following error:
INFO: 127.0.0.1 - - [21/May/2024 23:13:14] "GET /watched HTTP/1.1" 405 -
why does it state GET method when clearly the fetch function defined is using a POST method
why is that and can you help me debug my code.
